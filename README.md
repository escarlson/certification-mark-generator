[Certification Mark Generator](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/)
===

Note: this isn't working yet. Need to figure out how to host an SVG that is not cached. In the meantime you can use this:

[ ![Certification template](premade/certification-template.svg) ](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/)

[oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/)

[Open Hardware Facts](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/facts)
===

This graphic can be used to show what 3 licenses you are using with your open source hardware, as recommended by [OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/process.html).

SVGs can be generated at [oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/facts](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/facts).

Some common combinations will be pre-generated and hosted here for use:

## Testing area

This ought to display the certification mark SVG:

![certification mark](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/index.svg#code=US99999)

![certification mark](https://oshwa.github.io/certification-mark-generator/index.svg#code=US12345)
